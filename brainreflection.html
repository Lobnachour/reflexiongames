<h1>Brain Reflection</h1>
<p>This is a simple exercise to test the <b>reflection</b> of your <b>brain</b>, the faster the better, try to get a score of <b>0.20</b> in this <b>reflex test</b>. When you manage to reach that score then that means you're very fast, if you can't achieve that score then keep practicing. Practice makes perfect!</p>
<p>Human reflection is the capacity of humans to exercise a willingness to learn more about our fundamental nature, purpose and essence. <b>Brain reflection</b> invariably leads to inquiry into the human condition and the essence of humankind as a whole. Humans often consider themselves to be the dominant species on Earth, and the most advanced in intelligence and ability to manage their environment, thanks to the mind reflection.</p>
<h2>Instructions for the brain reflection exercise</h2>
<p>Click on <b>"start"</b> to begin the exercise for the brain reflection, and get ready, when the color changes then click on the big square as fast as you can, try to click in 0.20 second, that you would mean that you have a super fast reflection. Good luck!</p>
<h2>What is reflex?</h2>
<p>It's a spontaneous, simple and unlearned response which results in a specific behavioral response to a specific stimulus. Although with humans learned behavior dominates, reflexes however persist as an important and vital component of human behavior.</p>
<p>It's amazing how only one neuron is required to make the simplest known reflexes. However, most reflexes require activity in a large sequence of neurons. The neurons involved in most reflexes are connected by specific synapses to form functional units in the nervous system. Such a sequence begins with sensory neurons and ends with effector cells such as skeletal muscles, smooth muscles, and glands, which are controlled by motor neurons. The central neurons which are often interposed between the sensory and motor neurons are called interneurons. The sensory side of the reflex arc conveys specificity as to which reflex will be activated. The remainder of the reflex response is governed by the specific synaptic connections that lead to the effector neurons. A familiar reflex is the knee-jerk or stretch reflex. It involves the patellar (kneecap) tendon and a group of upper leg muscles.</p>
