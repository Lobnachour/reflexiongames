<h1>IQ Scale</h1>
<h1>What is the IQ Scale?</h1>
<p>The IQ Scale is a total score that is derived from certain standardized tests that are designed to assess the human intelligence.</p>
<h1>IQ Scale Range</h1>
<p>Your IQ is a measure of your intelligence. The higher the IQ the better. Your IQ is usually measured over a general IQ scale range and the standard IQ range is as follows:</p>
<p><b>140 and over :</b> If you have an IQ range of 140 and over, it means you are a genius or almost genius.<br><br>

<b>120 - 139 :</b> With an IQ of 120 to 139, it means you have very superior intelligence and your intelligence is better than most. A superior intelligence means that your intelligence is better than most people but not as high as those with an IQ of 140.<br><br>

<b>110 - 119 :</b> On the other hand, if you have an IQ of 110-119, it means you have a superior intelligence and that means that your intelligence is on middle ground- which means that it is high but not higher than most.<br><br>

<b>90 - 109 :</b> When you have an intelligence of 90-109, it means that you have an intelligence of normal or average people. Normal thinking means that you are less intelligent and generally have a slower thinking. So people who cannot get to the solution or are slower in thinking will mean that they have normal intelligence.<br><br>

<b>80 - 89 :</b> On the other hand, if you have an intelligence of 80-89, that means you are a dull person. A dull person or boring person means that they generally tend to indulge in things that are too enjoyable. Dull people tend not to indulge in things that are too demanding.<br><br>

<b>Below 80 :</b> Give it another try :) maybe you will see the logic behind some questions after several tries. Also make sure you didn't leave some questions unanswered, leaving a question unanswered will give you a 0 point for that question.<b><b>

</p>
<h1>Normal Distribution & IQ Scores</h1>
<p>
The properties of the normal distribution apply to IQ scores:

<b>50%</b> of IQ scores fall between <b>90</b> and <b>110</b><br>

<b>70%</b> of IQ scores fall between <b>85</b> and <b>115</b><br>

<b>95%</b> of IQ scores fall between <b>70</b> and <b>130</b><br>

<b>99.5%</b> of IQ scores fall between <b>60</b> and <b>140</b><br>
